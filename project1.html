                                            <p>The goal of the first print was to create a multicolored personalized nametag to serve as an easy introduction to the 3D printing process. <br> The 3MF project file for the project was downloaded Brandeis University's public workshop files and loaded into PrusaSlicer. After slicing, the GCode was transferred to a Prusa Mini 3D printer via USB. To allow for the nametag to be multicolored, the GCode was supposed to stop the printer at a certain point to allow for the use to switch the filament for a spool of a different color. Although the print was successful, the nametag was printed as a solid color rather than being multicolored as intended.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>The 3MF file for the project includes a color change, however, when importing a 3MF file using the import dropdown rather than dragging and dropping the file into the software, the file is imported as a 3D object rather than as a project. To correctly import the 3MF project file without dragging and dropping, one must, rather than importing the file, open it as a new project. . </p>

                                            <p>In spite of the my erroneous importing of the 3MF file, the first print was overall very successful. The text of the nametag shows some minor stringing and some undesired gaps are present in the lettering, however the text remains perfectly readable. The impact of these issues could easily be mitigated by simply printing at a larger scale. The greatest lesson that can be reaped from my failure to import the file correctly is that, even if it seems that everything has been done correctly, one should always check whether everything is in order with the slicing before starting to print; Measure twice, cut once.</p>

                                            <p>The second print involved in this project was a calibration torture test. I chose to print the classic Benchy3D torture test, a small tugboat with many holes, overhangs and small details to test the how accurately a printer can produce complex, difficult shapes.<br>The file was downloaded from the Benchy3D official website, sliced in PrusaSlicer, then printed on a Prusa Mini. Isopropyl alcohol was applied to the baseplate before printing to ensure that the print stuck, allowing for a more pure examination of printer capabilities rather than baseplate conditions.</p>
